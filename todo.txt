networking
--------------------------
spawnign enemies on the server and updating clients is better than 
having one client driving the spawning enemies and updating other clients.

however, spawning enemies every X seconds on the server is not a good idea because it should be every 120 frames 
but that means it would be driven by the client.
so how do other games handle this?
